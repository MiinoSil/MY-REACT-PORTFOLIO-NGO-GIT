        <p>My name is Andrew Ngo, a junior full-stack developer fresh out of bootcamp. Welcome to my Portfolio, I hope you enjoy some of my works and projects and grasp the level of my skills.</p>

        <p>A little more about myself. I currently reside in Souther California, and have been living here for most of my life. Before getting into coding, I graduated with a BS Degree in Biological Sciences from UCI. I later earned a MS in Healthcare Management.</p>

        <p>I love getting into computer technology, and web development followed. As I learned coding through the UCI Coding Bootcamp, I now view the web differently and can now understand some of the basic structures of how a website or app is built and the utilities used to solve demands and problems.</p>
